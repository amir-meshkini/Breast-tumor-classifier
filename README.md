# Breast-tumor-classifier
This is a beginner-level machine learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) with high accuracy.

Achieving high accuracy in the field of healthcare is of paramount importance among all data-related fields.

In this project, while the main goal was to achieve the highest possible accuracy, efforts were also made to minimize the required computational capacity.

The final model is able to predict whether a detected breast tumor is malignant with a high accuracy exceeding 99 percent. 

By applying some feature engineering methods the model could perform pretty well by having only half of the original data. 

| Data size | Accuracy | 
| :------ | :---------: | 
| `100%` | 99.1% |
| `50%` | 98.2% |
